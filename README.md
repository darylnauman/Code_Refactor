# Code Refactor Homework Assignment

## Description

This is a homework assignment I worked on for the University of Toronto SCS Coding Boot Camp. It was a refactoring exercise on marketing agency's main landing page. The focus was to replace non-semantic elements with semantic elements and to improve the accessibility of the site. Comments and white space were added to both the CSS stylesheet (style.css) and HTML file (index.html) to improve readability.
